# Tic-Tac-Toe [HTML,CSS & JS]
  1. A Tic-Tac-Toe game (project) made by just HTML , CSS and JS .
  2. Responsive Layou / Design .
  3. Third Basic JS project of mine , did not watch any tutorials , just used from internet sources such as documentation etc .  

# Note 
 - After a round , the game board automatically refreshes but scores don't , have to refresh for scores to reset .
 - Did not added the auto play button (since it was having some issue even though it was 90% complete ).
